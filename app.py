# this project goal is to give the user as much information on a stock he is interested in: 
# such as: current value (live), latest news related, market value, buyers - sellers ratio, graph of current status
# this will be done as the program takes a market ticker as an input and the rest is done by itself.
# features for the future: *a few tabs to enable multiple stocks status. **buy/sell reccomendation by technical analysis.
